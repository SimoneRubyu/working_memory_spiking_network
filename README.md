## Outline
The Python scripts in which the model is implemented are in the ``model`` directory.

To properly run the model, [this version](https://github.com/gmtiddia/nest-simulator-3.1) of the NEST simulator is needed. It is the [NEST 3.1 version](https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/tree/3.1-develop) with the additional synapse model ``tsodyks3_synapse`` implemented.
